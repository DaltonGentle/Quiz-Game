This is a True/False Quiz Game
I used classes to create this game. It was my first introcuction to classes.
It uses a question bank in the format of a dictionary where there is a question and a true or false answer.
It asks the user each question. Checking to see if the answer was correct and keeps the score.
After each answer it tells you the correct answer and your overall score out of the current number of questions asked.
You can replace the questions as long as you keep the same syntax as the first type of questions.
